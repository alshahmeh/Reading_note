# I did some things about this class
* The concept of a growth mindset is a popular topic lately, and I sometimes say to myself “Self, you need to embrace the growth mindset. The growth mindset is cool.”

Why? The aptly named growth mindset helps us grow in whatever we pursue – especially in our work. When we’re growing, we’re more productive. And when I’m productive, I feel better. And you can, too.

# * What is a growth mindset?
* A growth mindset believes that one’s fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort; intelligence and talent are simply good starting points. A growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning.

By contrast, in a fixed mindset, intelligence and talent are seen as fixed traits, suggesting that success comes from these inherent qualities alone, without the need for further development or effort.

Here’s a simple illustration highlighting the differences between a fixed and a growth mindset:

|avoid|challenges|embraced|
|-----|----------|--------|
|loses focus|obtacles|persist|
|vies as fruitless|effort|no pain no gain|
|ignore|ctiticism|learns from|
|views as threat|sucess of threat|in inspired by|



# *  Perseverance, gumption traps, and maintaining a growth mindset:
1. Challenges
2. obstacles
3. Effort
4. Criticism
5. Success of others
